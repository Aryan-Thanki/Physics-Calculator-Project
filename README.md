# Physics-Calculator-Project
In this project I have created a calculator using the programming language C# and the IDE Visual Studio. 
The calculator is made using the windows Form Application template for the .NET framework. 
It is created dynamically using a graphical user interface and object orientated programming. 
My exe application file requires data stored in the Buttons csv .txt file to draw and create my buttons on the form.
